# Mill_on_multithreading

The Animated Water Mill for Grain Grinding is an interactive simulation that showcases a traditional water mill mechanism used to grind grain and produce flour. The application utilizes multithreading to efficiently manage the backend operations and provides a smooth user experience. The backend is built using Java, while the frontend is developed using Next.js.

# Overview

The water mill simulation aims to demonstrate the intricate process of grain grinding using the power of flowing water. Users can interact with the application and witness the entire process, from loading the grain into the mill to watching the flour being produced as the water wheel turns.

# Features

Realistic Animation: The frontend employs Next.js to create a visually appealing and immersive animation of a water mill in action.
Multithreading Backend: Java's multithreading capabilities are harnessed to efficiently handle the various stages of the grain grinding process. This ensures smooth performance, even during computationally intensive tasks.
Grain Loading: Users can load grain into the mill and observe how it is fed into the grinding mechanism.
Flour Production: As the water wheel turns, the application demonstrates the flour production process, creating an engaging and informative experience.
